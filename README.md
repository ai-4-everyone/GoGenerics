# Go Generics: Comprehensive Examples Repository

Welcome to the **Go Generics Repository**! This repository is a one-stop resource for understanding, learning, and mastering generics in Go, introduced in version 1.18. Generics bring the power of type parameters to Go, enabling developers to write reusable and type-safe code without compromising on performance or readability. 

This repository contains carefully curated examples that cover a wide range of topics, from basic syntax to advanced patterns and practical use cases. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced Go developer, this collection will help you leverage generics effectively in your projects.

## ðŸš€ What's Inside

### **ðŸ”° Basic Generic Programs**
These examples introduce the foundational concepts of generics, helping you grasp the syntax and core features:
1. **GenericMap**: Demonstrates a generic map function to transform slices of any type.
2. **Swap**: A simple yet powerful example of swapping two values generically.
3. **FilterSlice**: Shows how to filter elements in a slice based on a user-defined condition.
4. **MapFunction**: Applies a function to each element in a slice and generates a new transformed slice.
5. **ReduceFunction**: Implements the reduce pattern, enabling aggregation of slice elements into a single value.
6. **FindElements**: A generic function to find elements in a slice that match specific criteria.

### **ðŸ“¦ Generic Data Structures**
Explore how generics can simplify and optimize the implementation of classic data structures:
7. **GenericStruct**: Introduces the concept of generic structs to hold values of any type.
8. **Box**: A simple container type for encapsulating generic values.
9. **GenericStack**: Implements a stack with common operations like push, pop, and peek.
10. **GenericQueue**: A queue implementation with enqueue and dequeue functionalities.
11. **GenericLinkedList**: A linked list with generic support for nodes of any type.
12. **GenericDictionary**: A map-like data structure that uses generics for key-value storage.

### **ðŸ§© Constraints and Advanced Generics**
Delve into the advanced use cases of generics with custom constraints, multiple constraints, and more:
13. **CustomConstraints**: Learn how to define and use custom constraints to restrict type parameters.
14. **BinarySearch**: Implements a generic binary search algorithm for slices of ordered types.
15. **MergeSortedSlice**: Merges two sorted slices generically and efficiently.
16. **ReverseSlice**: Demonstrates reversing a slice of any type generically.
17. **MultipleConstraints**: Combines multiple constraints for more specific type parameter requirements.
18. **NestedConstraints**: Explores how constraints can be nested for advanced type parameter logic.
19. **ConstraintsOrdered**: Uses the built-in `constraints.Ordered` constraint to handle ordered types.
